# DiscordBot
really simple discord bot that utilizes different APIS using the discord API resource and learning set up and implication of events

MAIN FUNCTION: The purpose of this bot was to utilize different kinds of API available for use and have the bot be able to respond to the different commands implemented here. The three different APIs utilized were very simple and random text/image outputs. These very very simple APIs allowed me to grasp a simple understanding of what APIs are
APIs Used: 
  1. https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random
  2. https://yesno.wtf/api
  3. https://zenquotes.io/api/random

Command Prefix used was "."
Commands: 
.yesorno -- if you ask the bot a yes or no question, it'll output either yes or no
.randomdog -- output a picture of a random dog
.quote -- output a "zen" quote and show who the said that quote

FILES: 
main.py -- to run the bot
discordbot.py -- a class of the discord bot that includes the code for the commands
